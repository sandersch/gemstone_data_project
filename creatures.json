From a distance away the Mistydeep siren looks like beautiful maiden with softly draping robes walking aimlessly along the shorelines but without the influence of glamor it becomes obvious this is no helpless maiden. Her bluish corpselike skin and milky eyes is a dead give away of her true nature to any wary adventurer.",

    "description": "The mountain goat is a blunt squarish-looking animal with a rather short body and humped shoulders. The narrow head has a black muzzle sharp pointed ears and a double beard of long hair on her chin and throat. The white coat has a soft woolly three to four inches thick undercoat. Long coarse guard hairs up to seven inches long form heavy mats over the shoulders and hips giving a humped appearance. The coat grows to within eight inches of each hoof where it abruptly stops giving the appearance of the goat wearing pants. As the days become longer and the weather warmer she begins to shed her heavy winter coat and replaces it with a short summer coat that is yellowish in color. Black hooves accent her normal white coat and are equipped with cushioned skid-proof pads for grip and traction on steep rocky surfaces. Atop her head slender black shiny horns rise in a smooth backward curve to a length of ten to twelve inches. Rings can be seen around each horn indicative of the number of winters she has survived.",

Her eyes are dark and wide framed with fringes of long lashes and in the depths of those expressive wells there flickers highlights of energy. Or perhaps they are coals of hatred waiting to be unearthed. The witch's hands move constantly her long fingers and elegant nails making constant motions as if they have manic agendas of their own.",
